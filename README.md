# Treasure Folder ðŸŽ‰

This is one of my **New Year** mini projects, a heartfelt tribute to my friends from Polytechnic Besut with whom I've shared incredible memories and learning experiences.

Most of the pictures may be a blast from the past, capturing moments we shared, but they're a treasure trove of nostalgia. The collection spans the time we spent together, with the most recent memories from our last semester.

Feel free to take a stroll down memory laneâ€”it's an interactive experience for you and fellow viewers.
